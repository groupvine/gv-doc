# Quick Start

Once your account is created, you're ready to send yourself an email composed in your personal inbox or your online account. 

## Add email addresses

If you would like to include more recipients, there are a few ways to do this.  For a handful of addresses, you can either [add them one at a time](/2-members/1_3-membersAdd.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-2members-13membersAdd) or [copy and paste a list of addresses](/2-members/1_1-membersAdd.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-2members-11membersAdd) to add them all at once.  Or, if you have a spreadsheet of addresses, you can [upload the file](/2-members/1_2-membersAdd.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-2members-12membersAdd) to your membership.

## Send an email

</div>

When ready, send a quick email from your personal inbox using your account's group email address, which Administrators can look up by signing into your account, clicking the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> and emailing "To" your **Address**, e.g. *myaccount*@groupvine.com, under **Core account settings**.  

(Note, to avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly compromised email account, after emailing from your inbox, a confirmation email will be  sent to you where you must confirm the email send before it can be forwarded to its recipients.)

Easy peasy.  And now you can check your [Email Feed](/4-feed/1-feedIntro.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-4feeed-1feedInto) for your new email.

Here are more details for sending from your [personal inbox](/3-send/2-sendInbox.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-3send-2sendInbox) or your [online account](/3-send/1-sendOnline.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-3send-1sendOnline).
