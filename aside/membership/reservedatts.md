# Reserved Member Attributes

Custom member attributes may consist of most characters other than
colons (':') and a handful of others, and must avoid the following
reserved member attributes.

Email delivery:

*  **Email**  member's primary email address,
*  **Opted Out** indicates whether the member has opted out (or hasn't yet opted-in) to receiving emails.

<span class="support">
Also, **Email AltN** is reserved for alternate addresses, where N is an optional integer (2, 3, ...),
although this is not typically supported for new accounts (unless grandfathered in).
</span>

* **Membership Vis** membership visibility for non-Admins (when

Miscellanous:

* Note that in addition to member attributes, import files are also
  used to specify sub-group and list membership, using header field
  labels prefixed by "list:" for list membership and "group:" for
  sub-group membership.  See [Membership
  Lists](./lists?gv-qargs=0) and [Membership
  Sub-groups](./groups?gv-qargs=0) for more information on
  these.

* Additionally, import columns with header labels prefixed with
  "info:" and "delivery:" (used in exports) and "ignore:" are silently ignored
  during imports.
