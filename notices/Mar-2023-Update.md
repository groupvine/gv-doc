## Improved Email Addressing

Improved Email Addressing makes it easier to select recipients by
community, sub-groups, individually selected recipients, lists or
attributes.  For any addressing selection, a plain-English summary is
now provided to help clarify exactly who would receive the email.

## Selecting Recipients for Drafts

Draft emails can be sent to individually selected recipients,
with or without being sent to the Administrators and Editors.

## More control of email visibility in Email Feeds

An email's visibility can now be changed to Public, Account members,
Sub-group members or Qualified members right in the Email Feed.
Qualified members are recipients based on a list, attribute or
individually selected recipients.

For example, generally when an email is sent to a list and based on
the group's default visibility, only list members would be able to
view the email in their Email Feed. However, Admins can now change the
email's visibility to permit all sub-group or account members to also
view it from their feed.

## Ability to hide Email Widget results

Results from Email Engagement Widgets, which allows you to add
questions to your email, can be hidden in emails to recipients and
optionally released at a later time.  For instance, for a secret
ballot you may wish to hide the results chart until after the voting
period.

Here's how you can set or change an email's widget settings:

* From your account settings page, set the default for all widgets.
 
* When composing a new email, make changes from the widget's
  Email-wide Settings tab which can be accessed when adding a new
  widget or by double-clicking on an existing widget.
 
* For a published email, select Change Widget settings from the
  email's action menu in the Email Feed.

## Smart inclusion of sub-group emails in account Email Feed

In accounts with sub-groups, you can configure your account's Email
Feed to automatically include the emails from the entire community,
including its sub-groups, that each viewer is entitled to see.  To
enable, be sure that “Sub-group Emails in Feed?” in your account
settings page is set to “Yes".

## Other Notable Changes 

* On the subscribe page, we've added a CAPTCHA which 
  asks the subscriber to complete a simple test to prove they are 
  a human and not a computer attempting to join your account.
   
* For accounts with sub-groups, from your account's Manage Sub-groups page, 
  a spreadsheet can 
  be downloaded containing all sub-group account information including 
  the sub-group email address.  This makes it easier to have all 
  addresses at hand than to individually look them up online.
