## Improved Email Addressing

Improved Email Addressing makes it easier to select recipients by
community, sub-groups, individually selected recipients, lists or
attributes.  For any addressing selection, a plain-English summary is
now provided to help clarify exactly who would receive the email.

Also Draft emails can be sent to individually selected recipients,
with or without being sent to the Administrators and Editors.

## More control of email visibility in Email Feeds

An email's visibility can now be changed to Public, Account members,
Sub-group members or Qualified members right in the Email Feed.
Qualified members are recipients based on a list, attribute or
individually selected recipients.

For example, with an email sent to a list and at its default
visibility, only list members would be able to view the email in the
Email Feed.  However, Admins can now change the emails visibility in
the Email Feed to permit all sub-group or account members to view it
in the Email Feed.

## Ability to hide Email Widget results

Results from Email Engagement Widgets, which allows you to add
questions to your email, can be hidden in emails to recipients and
optionally released at a later time.  For instance, for a secret
ballot you may wish to hide the results chart until after the voting
period.

## Smart inclusion of sub-group emails in account Email Feed

In accounts with sub-groups, you can configure your account's Email
Feed to automatically include the emails from the entire community,
including its sub-groups, that each viewer is entitled to see.  To
enable, be sure that “Sub-group Emails in Feed?” in your account
settings page is set to “Yes".
