## Choosing Feature Images in your Email Feed 

Admins can also change the featured images that appear in the email
summaries of the Email Feed.  By hovering over the image in an email
summary in the Email Feed, left & right arrows will appear allowing
you to scroll through the images contained in that email.  Their
choices will then be saved and used as the new feature images.

directly to its response page:
