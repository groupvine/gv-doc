## Email Feed for Published Emails

The Email Feed is your account's Home page that members and Visitors
can navigate to with the opportunity to subscribe.  

Emails are listed 
chronological and include published emails and posts of older emails and emails from a different service.

Unless the visibility of an email is changed by an Administrator,
members are only shown the emails that they were sent (or would have
been sent based on their current sub-group and list memberships).

General members will have options to refresh the feed (<img src="/docimages/refresh-feed-icon.png" height="22">), view the feed in Gallery view (<img src="/docimages/gallery-view-feed-icon.png" height="22">) or view the feed in Listing view (<img src="/docimages/listing-view-icon.png" height="22">).

Administrators and Editors will also have an **Options** filter in the Email Feed header to include sub-group and/or archived emails into their view of the feed.
