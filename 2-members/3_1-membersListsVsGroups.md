# Managing your Membership

## Guidelines on whether to use a List or Sub-group


In general, if a group of members could potentially benefit from a
level of autonomy, such as being managed by local administrators or by
having members of this group being able to send or reply-all to the
group (without also being able to send or reply-all to the entire
account membership), then using a sub-group is recommended.

On the other hand, to simply address a set of members within the 
account (or sub-group, if the list is created there) without the need
for any autonomy or policies different than the entire
account (or sub-group), then a simple list is recommended.


|                           |                     List                     |                      Sub-group                       |
|--------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------:|
| **Group Context**         | No group context of its own, just allows targeting emails to a subset of current account membership* | Allows targeting a sub-set of account membership, but also provides a new group context which could even include its own Lists |
| **Allowed sender policy** | Same as account policy*                      | Specific to sub-group                               |
| **Moderation policy**     | Same as account policy*                      | Specific to sub-group                               |
| **Membership delegation** | None                                         | Can have its own Admins                              |
| **Email delegation**      | None                                         | Can have its own Editors                             |
| **Email Feed**            | Included in account's Email Feed*            | Has its own Email Feed (with own visibility policy) |
| **Logo and color theme**  | Included in account (so same logo & colors)* | Can have its own logo & color theme                 |

<!--
| **Configuration options** | None                                         | Similar to account configuration but just for the sub-group |
| **Scope**                 | Lists can be created within a specific sub-group** | ... but not vice versa (although account Lists can be *used* within a sub-group) |

** Of course, Lists can also be created for the entire account too (as is the typical case).
-->

\* For Lists created within a specific sub-group, replace "account"
   with "sub-group".
