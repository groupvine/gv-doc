# Managing your Membership

<span id="gv-2members-31membersListsVsGroups"></span>


In general, if a set of members could potentially use a level of
autonomy, such as being able to reply-all to the others (without also
being able to reply-all to the entire account), then using a sub-group
is recommended.


On the other hand, to simply address a set of members within the same
account (or sub-group, if the list is created there) without the need
for specific degree of autonomy, or delegation, or policies different
than the entire account (or sub-group), then a simple list is
recommended.


|                       |                     List                     |                      Sub-group                      |
|---------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
| **Configuration**         | None                                         | Similar to account configuration but just for the sub-group |
| **Scope**                 | Lists can be created within a sub-group      | ... but not vice versa                              |
| **Allowed sender policy** | Same as account policy*                      | Specific to sub-group                               |
| **Moderation policy**     | Same as account policy*                      | Specific to sub-group                               |
| **Membership delegation** | None                                         | Can have its own Admins                             |
| **Email delegation**      | None                                         | Can have its own Editors                            |
| **Email Feed**            | Included in account's Email Feed*            | Has its own Email Feed (with own Visibility policy) |
| **Logo and color theme**  | Included in account (so same logo & colors)* | Can have its own logo & color theme                 |



* For Lists created within a specific sub-group, replace "acccount"
  with "sub-group".
