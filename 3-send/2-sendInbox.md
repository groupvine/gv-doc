## Send email from a personal email account

<span class="g4s sub">
<span class=highlight>
  
To avoid the risk of spammers sending emails to a group from a possibly compromised email account, after an email is sent from an inbox to an [unmoderated group](/3-send/4-sendSettings.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-2members-4sendsettings-use-moderation), a confirmation mail is emailed to the sender where the sender must confirm the email send before it can be forwarded to its recipients.

If you're interested in skipping this confirmation step, you can change the setting **Emails from personal inbox required confirmation?** on 
the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22">**Account Settings** page under **Email security** to `No`, although skipping 
the confirmation step opens your account to the possibility of unwanted emails being distributed when a (valid sender) member's personal email account has been hacked.

Also, all bounce message reports are now sent to the sender.

To send an email to your account from your inbox, use your account's **Address** found on the <img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Account Settings** page, for example:

```
lighthouselabs@groupvine.com
```

<span class="g4s sub"> 

Similarly, to send to a sub-group from your inbox, use the sub-group's **Address** found on the sub-group's 
<img src="/docimages/transparent-gear-icon.png" height="22"> **Sub-group Settings** page, for example:

```
team.lighthouselabs@groupvine.com
```

</span> <!-- g4s sub -->

Once your email is sent, it will appear in your Email Feed with <img src="/docimages/sent-from-inbox-icon.png" height="22"> to 
identify that the email was sent from a personal email account.  If your email isn't listed at the top, wait a minute and click <img src="/docimages/refresh-feed-icon.png" width="22"> in the Email Feed header to 
refresh the feed.

In general, emails will be "From" the sender's display name, which is the
First Name and Last Name attributes in their Profile, but the sender's email handler may preset the "From" to 
the name normally used to send email.

## Get the email address to send to lists or recipients with specific attribute values

To find the email address to target lists or recipients with specific attribute values, select **New Email** and then select **Send email from 
your own inbox**.  On the **Addressing** tab select the lists and attributes you want your email to target and copy the updated email 
address to the "To" field of your email in your personal inbox.  If you use this email address often, you might want to add it to your contacts so the address is readily available when sending.

## Get the email address to send a draft or "urgent" email

To send a draft or ["urgent"](/3-send/3-sendTexts.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-2members-3sendTexts) email, 
select **New Email** and then select **Send email from your own inbox**.  On the **Addressing** tab select *Send as a draft email* 
or *Mark email as urgent* and copy the updated email address to the "To" field of your new email in your personal email account.  

<span id="gv-3send-2sendInbox-useattrs"></span>
## Add predefined and custom attributes to customize your email

Personalize your emails by including pre-defined or custom attribute values by selecting **New Email** and then the **Personalize** tab.  For more
information about Member Attributes, click [here](/2-members/4-membersattributes.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-2members-4membersattributes).  

Also available are *Link to Profile* and *Link to Email Feed*, which can be included in your emails to give members a direct link access to their Profile and your account Email Feed.

**The clipboard must be used to copy and paste an attribute to your email created in your inbox.**  To add an attribute, *Link to Profile* or *Link to Email Feed* value to your email created in your inbox, click its clipboard (<img src="/docimages/clipboard-icon.png" width="22">) to copy its representation and then paste it into your email.  

</span> <!-- highlight -->

Note

* The ability to drag-and-drop a member attribute image 
from the **Personalize** depends on the email service 
and/or email app you use.  Please create a test email to try out the drag-and-drop 
method with your system before sending an email. For example, dragging-and-dropping should 
work for gmail users composing emails online using the 
Google Chrome browser.

## Add Email Widgets to collect information and ask questions right in your email

Ask questions or gather information directly in your email by adding Email Widgets.  Follow 
the instructions on the **Widgets** tab to add any of the four types of Widgets
(Text, Count, RSVP, and Yes-No).  The Email Widget's question is just normal text in your email.  For more information about Email Widgets,
