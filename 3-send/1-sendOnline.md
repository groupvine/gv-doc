### Where to start

To compose and send an email from your online account, select **New
Email** and then select **Prepare email online**.

By default the **New** tab is selected to create a new email from
scratch (Note, for your very first email, you'll start by entering the
email's subject).  You may also have a **Drafts**, **Templates**,
and **Published** tabs, where you can select an email from one of these tabs as a starting point.

* A Draft email is "under construction" and may have already been emailed as a
draft, but has yet to be sent/published to its intended recipients.  

* A Template is set up as a starting point for new emails that are sent often, e.g. weekly newsletters.  The templates on this tab
have been saved either in the current group or in a parent group.  

* Published emails have been sent to its recipients and are published to the group's Email Feed.  Click [here](/3-send/5-resend.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-5resend) for details on resending a published email.

### Use predefined and custom attributes to customize your email

Personalize your email by selecting an attribute from the **Pers…** menu (short for
Personalization) in the email editor.  

Added to your email and representing the attribute, is a placeholder which will be translated to the recipient's value in their received email. 
For example, if you select “First Name” from the Personalization menu, the placeholder <img src="/docimages/FirstName_attribute.png" height="22">
is added to your email.  When previewing your email, the placeholder 
is replaced with your First Name as set in your Profile.
For more information about Member Attributes, click 
[here](/2-members/4-membersAttributes.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-2members-4membersattributes).

Also available from the **Pers...** menu are *Link to Profile* and *Link to Email Feed*, which can be included
in your emails to give members a direct link access to their Profile and account Email Feed.

### Use Email Widgets to collect information and ask questions right in your email

<span class="sub g4s">

Ask questions or gather information directly in your email by selecting one of the 
five types of Email Widgets (Text, Count, RSVP, Yes-No,
Single/Multi-Choice) from the **Widget** menu.  Use normal text in your email to ask the question related to an Email Widget.
For more information about using Email Widgets,
click [here](/5-widgets/1-ewIntro.md?[LINK-QARGS-DOC]#gv-5widgets-1ewIntro).

### Publish!

When ready, click <img src="/docimages/compose-send.png" height="22"> to select your recipients and send/publish your email.  By default, your email will be sent to the entire group as non-urgent, otherwise:

* On the **Addressing** tab: Select **Send as a draft email** to send to group's Administrators and Editors only.  Select **Mark email as urgent** to 
have a text notification sent to recipients who want to
be notified of urgent emails.  Make selections to change the recipients
to list(s) or to specific Choice or Checkbox attribute values. 

* Use the **Select Individuals** tab to select specific recipients from your membership.

* Review recipient addresses on the **Recipient Addresses** tab.  This is a good way to eyeball that the recipient list is correct
before publishing an email.

After publishing your email, you will be redirected to the group's Email
Feed.  If your email isn't listed at the top, wait a minute and click <img src="/docimages/refresh-feed-icon.png" width="22"> in the Email Feed header to 
refresh the feed.

Note

* Emails will be "From" the sender's display name, which is the First Name and Last Name attributes as they are set in their Profile.

* Links in Preview are deactivated.
