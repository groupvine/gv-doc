# Email Widget Details and Features

<span id="gv-5widgets-6ewDetails"></span>
Here's a summary of key Email Widget details and features:

* Recipients can respond and comment from their email without
  signing-in or clicking-through to a survey, online document, or
  “invitation site.”

* Right from their email, recipients can see how others are responding
  and view up-to-date images that summarize responses, without needing
  to scroll through long threads of email replies.

* Names and summary data can be hidden from recipients to keep
  responses private.

* Responses and comments can be hidden from recipients in case a
  response is determined to be inappropriate. Click [here](https://www.groupvine.com/5-widgets/3-ewManage.md?gvdoc=1#gv-5widgets-3ewmanage-hide-unhide) for details.

* To keep all response information in one email, future recipients
  will be able to respond to a published email's Email Widgets when
  they’re added to the email's recipient list. For example, newly
  added account members can respond to an email previously published
  to the entire community.

* Visitors can view summary images (e.g., the result charts or last
  few responses to text threads) for public emails with Email Widgets.

* The color of the summary images are based on shades of your group's
  primary [theme color](https://www.groupvine.com/3-send/4-sendSettings.md?gvdoc=1#gv-2members-4sendsettings-theme-colors).

* All response data can be downloaded into a spreadsheet
  by Administrators and Editors anytime,
  see [here](/5-widgets/3-ewManage.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-5widgets-3ewmanage-download)
  for details.
  
* Double click on a widget to change its defaults and to configure
  widgets email-wide. It's important to give your widget a name to
  briefly describe its purpose. The name is used in several places:
  the caption to the widget's summary image's in the Email Feed, the
  column label when responses are downloaded to a spreadsheet, and the
  widget's description when hovering over its response in the response
  listing.

* [TBD] From the list of responses, Administrators and Editors can email a recipient or a group of recipients who have either responded, have yet to respond, or responded with a specific answer.

* [TBD] Recipients can comment on responses which sends an email notifying others in the response thread of the new comment.  Commenting can be a time-saver
because it’s a convenient way to send confirmations, share ideas, request more information, and “get back” to someone without having to look up their email address.
  
* Email notifications are sent to the participants for a response when
  a new comment is added to that response thread.

Email Widgets transform email for groups and communities into dynamic and engaging communications, and enhance the value (for recipients and senders) of each communication you send and drive greater participation and interaction from your community.
