## What are Email Widgets?

<span class="todo">

Email Widgets are questions added right to your email asking
recipients for information, which could be votes, polls, help
requests, and RSVPs, as well as soliciting opinions and comments. From
their inbox, recipients can add responses and see up-to-date images
that summarize all responses.  Also with commenting capabilities,
where recipients can add comments to other responses, it's possible to
engage your community in a discussion.

Below are some examples of the different types of widgets we offer.
For more information, see:

Email Widgets are a simple and powerful tool that make it easy to ask questions, collect information, start conversations and gather feedback right in an email.  From their inbox, recipients can add responses and comments and see up-to-date images that summarize Email Widget responses.  

Email Widgets can be used for almost anything you would like to ask your community: votes, polls, help requests, RSVPs, as well as soliciting opinions and comments, all which make it possible to engage your community in a discussion, embedded within the email, around these questions.

* In real-time and right from their email, recipients can see how others are responding and view up-to-date images that summarize responses.

* Responses and comments can be hidden from recipients in case a response is determined to be inappropriate.  Click [here](/5-widgets/3-ewManage.md?gv-qargs=0#gv-5widgets-3ewmanage-hide-unhide) for details.

* Email notifications are sent to all response participants when a new comment is added to the thread.

* To keep all response information in one email, future recipients will be able to respond to a published email's Email Widgets when they’re added to the email's recipient list.  For example, newly added account members can respond to an email previously published to the entire community.

* Visitors can view summary images for public emails with Email Widgets.
