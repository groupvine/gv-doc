## What are Email Widgets?

Email Widgets are questions added right to your email asking
recipients for information, which could be votes, polls, help
requests, and RSVPs, as well as soliciting opinions and comments. From
their inbox, recipients can add responses and see up-to-date images
that summarize all responses.  Also with commenting capabilities,
where recipients can add comments to other responses, it's possible to
engage your community in a discussion.

Below are some examples of the different types of widgets we offer.
