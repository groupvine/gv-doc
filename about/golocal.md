# GoLocal&trade; and GroupVine 4 School Sponsorships

GroupVine's GoLocal&trade; program leverages the GroupVine 4 School
email service to allow schools to add compelling, premium-level deals
to their sponsorship offerings for local businesses and organizations,
and also allow local businesses and organizations to be easily and
effectively promoted to local schools who use the GroupVine email
service.

If you are involved in offering sponsorships for your school, and
would like to add GroupVine GoLocal ad placement as a new sponsorship
offering, or as an additional feature to a premium sponsorship level, see the
<a href="#golocal-for-sponsorships">GoLocal for Premium School Sponsorships<a>
section below.

If you are a business or other organization wishing to promote to
schools in your area who use the GroupVine community email service,
<a href="#golocal-for-biz">read on into the next section.</a>

## GoLocal for Promoting Your Business or Organization to Local Schools

Promote your business or organization directly to, and be just a click
away from, any local school community that uses the free
<a href="https://www.groupvine.com/g4s" target="_blank"> GroupVine 4 School </a>
email service to communicate with their parent community, and it’s simple!

<div style="margin:20px auto; text-align:center">

</div>

In a nutshell, you only need to supply:

*  Your biz or org name & website address, if you have one
*  Your ad images (we can help you create them, for free!)

We'll then help activate your account (starting as low as
$69 for 2500 views) and your ads can start running as soon
as tomorrow, plus you'll receive monthly activity reports.

GoLocal is a fantastic way for businesses and other
organizations to promote themselves to their local
community, and it makes the school community happy to
see that the national ads in their emails have been
replaced with promotions by more friendly and relevant
local merchants. And unlike print advertising, each
email has only two ads, so yours will get plenty of
attention!

and/or have other questions, feel free to <a

### Ad Image Specifications

Schools that use the GroupVine service can use one of two email
formats that have different ad specifications.  These formats are <a
href="#golocal-ad-formats">detailed in the "Ad Image Types and
Specifications" section below.</a>


<span id="golocal-pricing"></span>
### GoLocal Pricing for Local Businesses or Organizations

Because of our goal to replace the national ads with more
friendly and relevant local promotions in as many of the
communities across the country as possible, we’ve set our
pricing to be extremely competitive with local
alternatives, particularly given that we only charge your
account when the email that includes your ad is viewed by
a recipient, and that each email only includes two ads.

Pricing is based on “View Credits,” which account for the
number of times email recipients view an email with your
ad(s) displayed. Each time a recipient views one of your
ads, the account associated with that ad is charged 1 View
Credit for a Standard ad, or 1.5 View Credits for a
Premier ad. Only the Side Skyscraper ad described above is
considered a Premier ad type, all others are Standard ads.

View Credit pricing is as follows (please 
<a href="mailto:support@groupvine.com?subject=GoLocal%20high-volume%20pricing&body=My%20website:%20%0D%0AQuestions:%20%0D%0A" target="_blank">
contact us</a> directly for higher volume pricing):

<table style="margin:20px auto">
  <tr>
    <th width="33%">Price</th>
    <th width="33%">View Credits</th>
    <th width="33%">Discount</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>$69</td>
    <td>2,500</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$119</td>
    <td>5,000</td>
    <td>14%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$219</td>
    <td>10,000</td>
    <td>21%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$399</td>
    <td>20,000</td>
    <td>28%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that by using View Credits, we ensure that your
account will only be charged when your ad is actually
viewed.

To start running your ad, we’ll email you an invoice using
PayPal (which accepts all major credit cards). After
receiving your payment, your ad should typically be ready
within 24 hours to be begin running in the next emails
sent by the school communities you have specified!

Email us</a> if you have any questions or to get started!

### GoLocal FAQ for Local Businesses and Organizations

* **Can I advertise to more than one school community?**
Yes, just let us know which schools your’d like to target and we can
include your ad in their community emails.

* **What statistics are included in the monthly activity reports?**
Each GoLocal advertiser will receive a monthly report 
that shows, for each active ad: 1) The total number of
views and clicks for your ad during the month, and; 2) The
number of view credits remaining in your account.

* **What if there are more advertisers than ad slots available?**
If this is the case, then ads will be fairly rotated.

* **Can I change my ad once I make a payment?**
Yes!  You can update a particular ad image as frequently as every month.

* **What if I only provide only one ad image for one of
the email templates, and the school sends some emails using the
other email template?**
Your account is only charged when ads are included in an
email and viewed, so in this case, your account will not
be charged.  We suggest providing ad images for both
templates so your ad will be rotated through the ad slots
regardless of the template used.

## GoLocal for Premium School Sponsorships

If you are involved with your school's efforts to reach out to local
merchants and other local organizations with sponsorship promotions,
we can help!

As you may have noticed, if you use the GroupVine 4 School (G4S)
service, your school emails include <a href="#golocal-ad-formats">two
ad slots,</a> usually near the very top of the email.  These ad slots
could be dedicated for use by up to five sponsors that you select,
either as a separate sponsorship offering or packaged as an added
feature of an existing, premium sponsorship offering.

The best part is that we'll work directly with the merchants to help
them create and post their ads.  All you'll need to do is let us know
which ones you've selected.  Any other sponsorship details, including
the sponsorship/donation amounts, are totally up to you.

There are two basic models for converting your standard GroupVine 4
School (G4S) service to a G4S-Sponsorship service, depending
on what's easist for your school:

1. Add the <a href="https://www.groupvine.com/pricing" target="_blank"> GroupVine
   subscription service</a>, for your school but retain the email ad
   slots that then become available for your own sponsorships.  All
   sponsorship/donation amounts would continue to flow directly to the
   school.  You would simply let us know which sponsors to work with
   to create and activate their email ads.

2. Continue with the standard, free GroupVine 4 School email service,
   and simply direct the merchants you select to work with us to 
   create and activate their ads.  As a school-selected sponsor, we 
   would offer these merchants an additional 10% discount 
   over the standard <a href="#golocal-pricing">GoLocal pricing</a>,
   allowing you to promote "discounted ad placement at the top of school
   emails" with your premier sponsorships.

## Ad Image Types and Specifications

GroupVine 4 School communities can send emails using one of the
following two basic template formats (a given school typically uses
one or the other for their emails, not both).

  <div style="margin:20px auto; text-align:center">
    <img src="/docimages/golocal-side-ads.jpg" width="70%">
    <div style="display:inline-block">Template One - Ads on the side</div>
  </div>

  <div style="margin:20px auto; text-align:center">
    <img src="/docimages/golocal-top-ads.png" width="70%">
    <div style="display:inline-block">Template Two - Ads in the top banner</div>
  </div>

For GoLocal businesses, the two Top Banner ads and the Side Square ad
are “Standard” ads, and priced the same. The Side Skyscraper ad is a
“Premium” ad, and priced 50% higher than the Standard ads.

Ad images should be provided using JPG, PNG, or GIF image
file types.  If you provide an ad image using a different
file type, we can typically convert it for you.  Note that
animated GIFs are generally not supported, as they do not
work in many email readers.

The file size for ad images should be no more than 150
kBytes.  If you provide a larger ad image file, we can
typically reduce it for you.
