# GroupVine 4 School - About the ads

## Why the ads?

Your school community is using GroupVine's email service to help
inform and engage your school community. The ads allow GroupVine to
offer the service to your school for free!

# Can we put in our own ads?

Yes, we call this GoLocal™! Interested in using the ad space in these
emails as an additional sponsorship offering for your school, or to
help promote your business to this community and put your business
just one click away?  You can learn more about our GoLocal™
advertising service <a href="/about/golocal">here,</a> and/or <a
href="mailto:support@groupvine.com">send us an email </a> for other
details and we'll help you get started!

# Can I remove the ads all together?

If your school would like to remove ads all together, we have an
option for you too! In fact, for non-profit organizations (such as
school parent-teacher organizations, in most cases) we offer a
discounted subscription service. Click <a href="/pricing">here</a> for
more details on our pricing (and be sure to request the "Non-profit
Pricing" if that applies), or as always, feel free to email us with
any questions!
