# About the ads for free accounts

## Why the ads?

Your community is using GroupVine's email service to help
inform and engage your membership.  The ads allow GroupVine to
offer the service to your community for free.

## Can I remove the ads all together?

If you would like to remove ads all together, you can sign up for a
subscription service at any time.  Click <a href="/pricing">here</a>
for more details on our pricing (and be sure to request the
"Non-profit Pricing" if that applies), or as always, feel free to <a
href="mailto:support@groupvine.com">email us</a> with any questions!

## Can we put in our own ads?

If you are a school community using our free GroupVine 4 School
service, then yes, you can use this ad space for your own ads!  We
call this our GoLocal™ service. With GoLocal™ the ad space can be used
either as an additional sponsorship offering for your community, or to
help promote your local business to this community putting the business
just one click away.  You can learn more about our GoLocal™
advertising service <a href="/about/golocal">here,</a> and/or <a
href="mailto:support@groupvine.com">send us an email </a> for other
details and we'll help you get started!
